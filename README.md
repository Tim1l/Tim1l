<details>
<summary><b>RL Trading Agent for BTC/USD (EV 0.72)</b> – High-Performance Reinforcement Learning</summary>
  
Developed a sophisticated PPO-based reinforcement learning agent for BTC/USD trading on a 15-minute timeframe, leveraging a custom Gym environment with a proprietary reward function. Integrates 80+ high-signal entry points (TP=SL=ATR, win rate >60% in backtests) derived from multi-timeframe market patterns (M15, H1, H4, D1). Features a TCN feature extractor (64-256 channels, dilations [1,2,4,8], kernel=10) and action masking for compliance, achieving robust profitability from epoch 1 (32% profit at 10% drawdown in bullish phases). Optimized for scalability up to $15M without slippage, with ongoing enhancements for balanced long/short trading.  
*Tech Stack: Python, PyTorch, Stable-Baselines3, Custom TCN, Pandas, NumPy, Bybit/MT5 APIs*  
*Repo: [RL BTC Trading Agent](https://github.com/Tim1l/rl-btc-trading-agent)*  
*Monetization: Contact me to customize this agent for your fund’s trading strategy.*

<details>
<summary><b>BTC Trend Predictor (68% Accuracy, 0.67 F-Score)</b> – Real-Time Multi-Timeframe Forecasts</summary>
  
Built a hybrid TCN-LSTM model with MultiHead Attention for predicting the next candle’s direction (4h, 1d, 1w timeframes). Achieves 67-68% accuracy and 0.67 F-score on out-of-sample data, surpassing random baselines by 16-18%, with streaks of 50+ correct predictions. Processes high-frequency OHLCV data via CCXT, computes 20+ technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands), and applies robust normalization (log1p, tanh) for stable predictions. Deployed 24/7 with rigorous data quality checks (NaN/gap detection, forward-filling).  
*Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow, Keras-TCN, Pandas, TA-Lib, CCXT*  
*Repo: [Crypto BTC Trend Prediction](https://github.com/Tim1l/crypto_btc_trend_prediction) (currently private)*

<summary><b>PineScript Strategies (500+ Scripts)</b> – Multi-Timeframe TradingView Systems</summary>
  
Crafted 500+ PineScript v6 strategies for TradingView, focusing on multi-timeframe analysis (M15, H1, H4, D1) and market phase decomposition (ADX-based). Features 80+ core strategies with win rates of 55-70% and profit factors of 1.3-2.0, integrated with RL reward shaping. Utilizes RSI, Bollinger Bands, EMA, HMA, and ATR without curve-fitting, ensuring robustness across market conditions. Ready to enhance any trading system with custom strategies.
