<summary><b>RL Trading Agent for BTC/USD (EV 0.72)</b> ‚Äì High-Performance Reinforcement Learning</summary>

**Overview**  
Developed a sophisticated PPO-based reinforcement learning agent for BTC/USD trading on a 15-minute timeframe, leveraging a custom Gym environment with a proprietary reward function. Integrates 80+ high-signal entry points (TP=SL=ATR, win rate >60% in backtests) derived from multi-timeframe market patterns (M15, H1, H4, D1).

**Key Features**  
- **Advanced Architecture**: Utilizes a TCN feature extractor (64-256 channels, dilations [1,2,4,8], kernel=10) with action masking for trade compliance.  
- **Performance**: Achieves robust profitability from epoch 1 (32% profit at 10% drawdown in bullish phases).  
- **Scalability**: Optimized for up to $15M without slippage, with ongoing enhancements for balanced long/short trading.  

**Tech Stack**  
- Python, PyTorch, Stable-Baselines3  
- Custom TCN, Pandas, NumPy  
- Bybit/MT5 APIs for real-time execution

<summary><b>BTC Trend Predictor (68% Accuracy, 0.67 F-Score)</b> ‚Äì Real-Time Multi-Timeframe Forecasts</summary>
  
Built a hybrid TCN-LSTM model with MultiHead Attention for predicting the next candle‚Äôs direction (4h, 1d, 1w timeframes). Achieves 67-68% accuracy and 0.67 F-score on out-of-sample data, surpassing random baselines by 16-18%, with streaks of 50+ correct predictions. Processes high-frequency OHLCV data via CCXT, computes 20+ technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands), and applies robust normalization (log1p, tanh) for stable predictions. Deployed 24/7 with rigorous data quality checks (NaN/gap detection, forward-filling).  
*Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow, Keras-TCN, Pandas, TA-Lib, CCXT*
