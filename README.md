<summary><b>RL Trading Agent for BTCUSDT (EV >0.72)</b> ‚Äì High-Performance Reinforcement Learning</summary>

**Overview**  
Developed a sophisticated PPO-based reinforcement learning agent for BTC/USD trading on a 15-minute timeframe, leveraging a custom Gym environment with a proprietary reward function. Integrates 80+ high-signal entry points (TP(ATR)=SL(ATR), win rate >60% in backtests) derived from multi-timeframe market patterns (M15, H1, H4, D1).

**Key Features**  
- **Advanced Architecture**: Utilizes a TCN feature extractor (64-256 channels, dilations [1,2,4,8], kernel=10) with action masking for trade compliance.  
- **Performance**: Achieves robust profitability from epoch 1 (32% profit at 10% drawdown in bullish phases).  
- **Scalability**: Optimized for any crypto exchange or MT5 broker without slippage for large enough portfolio.  

**Tech Stack**  
- Python, PyTorch, Stable-Baselines3
